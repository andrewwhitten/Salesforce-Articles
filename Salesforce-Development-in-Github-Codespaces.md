The idea of coding in the cloud is compelling for many reasons:

	1) Clean environment to build and run your code each time
	2) Rent CPU cores and RAM just for the time that you need them
	3) Use the same environment from different devices throughout the day (MacBook, Desktop PC, iPad, even your phone should you be so inclined)
	4) No need to buy an expensive and heavy new MacBook Pro with M1 Max - all the heavy lifting is now in the Cloud
	5) Faster to provision working environment for new team members

Salesforce have announced their cloud based development IDE, Code Builder, way back in June 2020. Recent rumors suggested that it might see beta in Spring '22, however there is no mention of it in the new Release Notes. Additionally it isn't clear how much longer it would take to get to GA even if it was released as beta in say Summer '22.

As compelling as Code Builder might sound, GitHub has been offering and improving their equivalent Codespaces product for a while now, and although it isn't designed for Salesforce, it basically works well with most coding requirements today.
